#### What is Git?
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;* **Git** is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.*
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*Every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with a complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.*
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*The Git version control system functionality is available at the command line in macOS and is also available through the user interface in many integrated development environments. Typically the command line and functionality in an IDE are both used in development. In this course, you are going to first learn how to manage a pro丿ect using Git/GitHub on the command line. Later you will learn how to use an IDE's version control user interface.*
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*Every software engineer needs to learn how to use Git. Although there are other version control systems, Git is currently one of the most utilized.*
