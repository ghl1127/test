#### What is Git?

* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You could use Git on your standalone computer to manage some aspects of version control, but you would be missing some abilities that can only be obtained using a Git server such as collaboration and having a copy of the repository stored remotely for backup.
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;GitHub is not the only Git hosting available. Another host is Bitbucket from Atlassian. But, GitHub is the most popular and well known Git hosting service.
