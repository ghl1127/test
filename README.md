#### What's Markdown?
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.*
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.*
* &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it. Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it . It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Atom text editor.*


#### Markdown application scenarios
1. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*programmer. It is used to write technical documents, record technical codes, describe project functions, etc. as mentioned above, markdown can track the historical status, which is very convenient for internal personnel to communicate with each other.*
2. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*Researchers or students. It is used to write papers, blog posts, take notes, etc. now most web sites or software editors also support the markdown function. You can see the effect directly by writing on the left and on the right, so that they can write more quickly. It should be noted that most web sites or software support the basic syntax of markdown, but the support of some extended syntax is different.*
3. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*Job seekers. Used to create a resume. Especially for those who are engaged in it work, the resume made with markdown will be more popular with recruiters.*
